#					Briefly what the program does.							 #
##############################################################################

The TestProg class is the one with the main function.
First it checks if the command line argument is passed.

This command line argument needs to be the path to the file containing the test
X value cases, this X values need to be integers (or long) written line after
line in the passed file.
This is done to stream-line the process of testing multiple cases.

Then the ListOfPrimes class is the one that performs the sieve of Eratosthenes
algorithm to fine the prime numbers up to the given X value of each line in
the input file passed on the command line.

Now for each of the test cases (X) a list of the prime numbers are written to
a text file with then name X. The prime numbers are stored in this files for
each line of the input. These files are written into the the output directory.


{
1. The user inputs the upper limit of the prime numbers he needs. The code then
generates all prime numbers up to that number than stores them onto a text file.
2. To make things a little bit simpler the user is allowed to give the test
cases into a text file which is then passed into the program as command line
parameter.
3. The output of each test case are then written to a text file in an output
directory, each text case output is written with the filename as the upper
limit given to the case.
